        <h1 class="content1">Legend TSA was established in 2010 with only 11 members and has only grown since. Today, there are over 90 members in the Legend TSA Chapter. Every year, we get new and innovative members eager to learn and create, along
          with previous members who have a few years of experience under their belt.</h1>

          <b>Creed:</b> I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes
          of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are
          mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect
          for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day with each task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my fellow
          Americans.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Motto:</b> Learning to lead in a technical world.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Mission Statement:</b> The Technology Student Association enhances personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in STEM, whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions,
          and related programs.
