                        <p class="flow-text col s12">As superintelligent AI becomes a reality, most researchers believe that it is unlikely that an AI will ever be able to genuinely exhibit emotions like love and hate, because of this there is no reason to expect AI to become intentionally benevolent or malevolent. Instead AI might have other ways of becoming a risk. Two scenarios are most likely.</p>
                         <ol class="flow-text" style="list-style-type: disc;">
                            <li> AI is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons are created with artificial intelligence, and theses systems are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could be devastating leading to mass casualties. With multiple AIs in the hands of different people could also inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties. These systems would be programmed to be very difficult to "shut off" to keep the enemy from turning them off, because of this humans could plausibly lose control of the situation. This risk is present with narrow AI, and as AI increases in autonomy and intelligence so does the risk increase</li>
                             
                            <li>AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method to achieve that goal: An AI can develop destructive methods when people fail to fully align the AI's goals with our goals, which is strikingly difficult. If you ask an obedient intelligent car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it could end up being chased by helicopters after running over pedestrians, doing what you wanted but not literally what you asked for. If a superintelligent system is tasked with a geoengineering project, it could end up wreaking havoc on our ecosystem as a side effect, and view humans trying to stop it as a challenge to be met.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p  class="flow-text col s12">These examples illustrate concern for the AI's competence, not its malevolence. An AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, but if its goals aren't exactly the same as ours, we will have a problem. You're probably not a horrible ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice every chance you get, however, if you're in charge of a hydroelectric green energy project and there's an ant hill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. The main goal of our AI development team is to never put humans in the ant's positions.</p>

                        <p  class="flow-text col s12">AI won't wake up one day and immediately see humans as a threat to be eliminated. This is because it is very unlikely that humans will ever create a truly alive and sentient AI, instead the AI will follow set parameters to meet a goal. In the process to reach its goal the AI could do things that humans don't agree with, if it was tasked with lowering pollution levels the AI could see the fastest way to stop pollution from rising is to stop the producers of pollution, aka humans. All of these risks can be dealt with and mitigated through thorough test and research.

                        <h4 class="col s12">Aviation</h4>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">The use of Arrow in the Air Operations Divisions (AOD) is mainly for simulations. AI can simulate enemy operators in combat training simulators, mission management aids, post processing of simulator data into statistics, and supports systems for tactical decision making.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">The use of Arrow in the AOD is already proving to be very useful. Airplane simulators utilize Arrow to process the data taken from simulated flights into useful numbers. Arrow can also help come up with the best success scenarios and maneuvers in aircraft warfare simulations. Utilizing these scenarios Arrow is able to come up with strategies based on the size, placement, speed, and strength of the enemy forces as well as the AOD's forces. Arrow can then assist pilots in during air combat by providing them with the best possible maneuvers, as well as eliminating maneuvers that would be impossible for a human to perform. Multiple aircraft are needed to get good approximations for some calculations, Arrow allows simulated pilots rather than real ones to be used to get the data. These computer simulations are also used to train future air traffic controllers.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">The AOD also uses Arrow for speech recognition software. The air traffic controllers (ATC) give commands to the simulated pilots and the pilots are supposed to give responses back. These programs that incorporate speech software must be trained through repeated uses, which means that they use neural networks. The continued use and improvement of Arrow is imperative in situations with speech recognition because ATCs use very specific dialog and the software needs to be able to communicate correctly and promptly everytime.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">Arrow has also been incorporated to run on damaged aircraft. Arrow enables the damaged aircraft to continue to fly until it reaches a safe landing zone. Arrow compensates for the damaged components by relying on the undamaged components. Arrow utilizes a neural network in order to learn how best to optimize each aircraft's components. </p>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">Arrow as also been developed based on a Intelligent Autopilot System (IAS). Arrow acts as an IAS, this means that Arrow behaves like a highly experienced pilot who is faced with an emergency situation, such as severe weather, system failure, or turbulence. To develop this experience in Arrow supervised machine learning was used, this is where Arrow was treated as a human pilot going to a flying school. Once Arrow was deemed to have enough experience, it was given full control and overserved by the pilot as it executes the training exercises.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">The Intelligent Autopilot System combines the principles of Behavioral Cloning and Apprenticeship Learning where the autopilot observes the low-level actions required to maneuver the aircraft and the high-level strategy used to apply those actions. IAS implementation employs three phases; pilot data collection, training, and autonomous control. With these strategies Arrow creates an autonomous autopilot that assists pilots in responding to emergency situations.</p>

                        <h4 class="col s12 mhead">Education</h4>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">Arrow AI has been designed to help tutor students. Arrow can be utilized as an intelligent tutoring system, or ITS, for higher education. This educational system has been used to teach Air Force technicians to diagnose electrical system problems in aircraft. Arrow as also been used by to train Navy recruits in technical skills in a shorter time. </p>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">Arrow AI can not only help the students but the teachers. Since Arrow AI has advanced language processing and machine learning, it can be used for automatic grading of assignments as well as data driven understanding of individual students needs. This automatic learning about students has led to Arrow being used as a Massive Open Online Course or MOOCs where students from around the world can learn about a multiplicity of different subjects. This large data pool of students also allows Arrow to utilize learning analytics to improve the quality of learning at a scale. Arrow AI helps students learn faster and better, and is already in use.</p>

                        <p class="flow-text col s12">Arrow AI has potential in the medical field as well. Approximately twelve million adults are misdiagnosed every year in the US alone; Arrow AI with its advanced machine learning and neural network is able to look at diagnostic scans for a patient and correctly diagnose them with a higher success rate than professional doctors.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">Arrow AI is also able to help with mining medical records to provide useful information, designing treatment plans, assisting with medication management, provide consultations, drug creation, and using an avatar in place of a patient for clinical training.</p>

                        <h4 class="col s12 mhead">Human Resources and Recruiting</h4>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">Arrow AI can be used for companies recruiting as well. There are three ways Arrow AI can be used by human resources and recruiting professionals. Arrow AI can be used to screen resumes to rank candidates according to their level of qualification. Through job matching platforms, Arrow AI can also be used to predict a candidates success in any role. Arrow AI has also been used as a recruiting chat bot that can automate repetitive tasks.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">Normally, resume screening requires an HR professional or other recruiter to scan through a database of resumes for hours. Now, Arrow AI utilizes machine learning algorithms to automate the screening process. Arrow AI can perform over 200,000 computations on each resume in seconds and then design a custom interview based on the candidates skills and qualifications.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">Arrow AI can utilize neuroscience based games, facial and speech analysis, and recorded interviews to predict hiring success for candidates. Using Arrow AI also allows companies to increase their applicants and have a more diverse workplace.

                    <p class="flow-text col s12">Arrow AI will be a finished product. These steps include the discovery and analysis phase, the prototype implementation and evaluation phase, the minimum viable product phase, and finally product release.</p>
                    <ol class="flow-text">
                        <li>Discovery and Analysis Phase</li>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">This phase lays the groundwork for the rest of the development time. To start off the business must be set up along with project objectives.
                        The company will start out by analyzing the customer's business processes, expectations, assets, and current metrics. At this stage, the business must define the success factors, timeline, budget, and applicable technological stack. 
                        At the end of the process, the team decides if the AI concept is possible or not, and what scope of work is needed for the next move, mostly prototype development. This step normally takes around 5-7 business days.</p>
                        
                        <li>Prototype and Evaluation Phase</li>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">The next step is implementing an AI-based prototype.
                        This prototype is created as a business model to test the feasibility and proof of concept for the AI. It can be as limited as a text or drawing based mock up, or as complex as a sophisticated code-based prototype. The prototypes are then shown and discussed with the clients. 
                        The prototyping step allows for a much cheaper and much lower risk way to test a design with a customer before fully committing to one idea. This step normally takes around $25,00 including estimation for the MVP or another next stage required.</p>
                        <li> Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</li>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">The main difference between the MVP and the prototype is that the MVP is viable product, while the prototype is a software visual representation.</p>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">The MVP is the real product with a set of basic and functional features developed with the prototype in mind. The MVP is created with the customer's real data and then exposed to a small group of real customers for feedback. The feedback is used as an inexpensive way to modify the system. Average MVP cost ranges from $35,000-$100,000 depending on the project size and complexity.</p>
                        
                        <li>Product Release</li>
                        <p class="flow-text col s12">The last phase is the product release. The product is released with a set of predefined features and then launched to the market. The previous steps had a lot of emphasis on the requirements given by the customer, so at this step the end product has minimal risks. </p>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="flow-text col s12">The final prices is affected by data issues and the required algorithm's performance. Normally the finally price comes out to $100,000-$300,000 depending on the complexity and scope of the project. Arrow AI, for each potential uses, would cost $100,000-$300,000. The total cost of Arrow AI for all of the potential uses combined would cost anywhere from $1,000,000-$3,000,000.</p>
