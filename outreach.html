          <h1 class="content2">Fleece for Fighters is a program that we've been doing at Legend High School to create fleece blankets for pediatric cancer patients at Children's Hospital.

            The project was started at the beginning of the 2017 school year and has already created as many as 50 blankets.

            All the blankets will be finished and shipped off before the end of school year.</h1>

          <h1 class="content2">Blacklight Bingo was an event to raise awareness about TSA and encourage involvement of the other Legend students and the surrounding community. The event was also a fundraiser to help members offset the cost of the
            TSA State Conference.

            Blacklight Bingo was started within the first few weeks of the 2016 school year. Our officers worked around-the-clock to promote the event and to get people interested. People from the community could buy a ticket and come participate to
            win prizes at Legend.

            The event was held on November 6 in the Legend lunch room and raised a total of $500. This money helped current members of Legend TSA by lowering the cost of the State Conference, which also made TSA more attractive to potential future
            members.</h1>

          <h1 class="content2">Every year, Legend partners up with Make-A-Wish and does a Wish Week where there are a variety of events to raise money to help a child with a deadly disease.

            The main event of Wish Week is the Penny Stalls. Students can bring in pennies and can do anything to them (freeze them in water, jello...) and the teachers can't start class until they have counted all the pennies.

            In an average day during Wish Week, students raise over $1,000 in pennies. Some of the officers and advisors of TSA then sort through the pennies to add up the total amount for every day.

            Legend High School is anticipating raising $60,000 for this Wish Week.</h1>
